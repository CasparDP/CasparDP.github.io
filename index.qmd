## About Me

::: {.monitor-box}
Associate Professor at Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam

Primary research focus: **Economic consequences of reporting transparency**  
Currently, I am interested in how disclosure practices affect individual and/or market behavior and corporate outcomes.
:::

My research has been published in leading journals including *Journal of Financial Economics*, *The Accounting Review*, and *The Review of Financial Studies*, investigating how information environments impact corporate misconduct, industry coordination, and mergers & acquisitions, with a particular focus on the interplay between information asymmetry and regulatory frameworks.

#### Owner exposure through firm disclosure

We show that companies named after their owners tend to be more opaque in their financial disclosures, particularly when revealing such information might expose sensitive owner details and attract social stigma. We also show that when disclosure is forced, these owners are more likely to change their firms' names, and new firms are less frequently named after their founding owners.

#### Mandatory Financial Disclosure and M&A Activity

We investigate the impact of mandatory financial disclosure on mergers and acquisitions. We find that required disclosure boosts M&A activity by reducing information frictions, as evidenced by an increase in both the number and volume of private firms becoming targets.
