Hi, I am an associate Professor at Rotterdam School of Management (RSM) Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands. This is my personal website that I use to gather things that I do in my job, such as my teaching, useful resources, and publications, but also to not loose track of the shenanigans that I do on the side. 

**This website is still under construction!**


<!-- On this site I keep a list of [my publications](papers), [presentations](talks), 
and [my CV](cv.pdf), as well as a [technical blog](blog.html). -->
