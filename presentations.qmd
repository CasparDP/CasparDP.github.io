### Education Day 2025

*February 2025 at RSM*

This presentation showcases how I envision to implement LLMs in the feedback process during MSc thesis supervision. Importantly, this is one of my side-hustles, so I'll update it as time permits. My ambition is to bring it to production and make it available to all thesis supervisors - in the accounting department at least. I want to stress that this is far away from being a reality, but I am (was) excited to share my vision during our departmental Education Day. 

I plan to include more details about the practical steps and potential challenges in the implementation. Additionally, I aim to outline potential use cases, e.g. different prompts for different stages of the thesis trajectory, and gather feedback from peers to refine this idea further.

### Data & Coding
*September 2024 at RSM*

The presentation below was meant to bring our incoming academic director up to speed with the current developments in our new Data and Coding online course. By now, it ran for the first time and I hopefully have the time to update the slides to reflect the experiences and feedback from the first run.
